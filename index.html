            <p>I am a recent college graduate proficient in computer programming and graphic design who is ready to enter the workforce. I have gained experience in these fields by regularly working on side projects since I was a child, as well as college education and a little work experience. I am very accommodated with independent work, but also very cooperative in teamwork. In the workplace, I always put the business's needs above my own. I will help however I can to the best of my ability.</p>

                        <img class="previewImage" src="previews/excelSystem.jpg" alt="Screenshot of an inventory management system built with Excel">
                        <p>While working at Stayton Animal Supply, I was given the opportunity to design an inventory management system for the business to use.</p>
                        <p>Coded as a Visual Basic macro, it provided the basic necessities for managing products, such as creating, deleting, editing and searching for items. It was successfully used to calculate the business's product inventory at the end of the fiscal year. It was used for 1-2 months. Management was satisfied with the inventory system, however, they decided to deprecate the project because of an opportunity that arose to invest in a professional, server-based inventory system.</p>
                        <p>The code is not available online, however I can present it in person upon request.</p>

                        <img class="previewImage" src="previews/historysRole.png" alt="Composition Preview">
                        <p>These compositions take place during the early Renaissance period, while the pictures on the wall portray what will come of the future from that time period, specifically the late 1800s and early 1900s.</p>
                        <p>The compositions were created to contrast the effects that knowledge has on society through time. The top image shows history being studied and a good future on the wall. The bottom image displays history being ignored and a threatening future on the wall.</p>
                        <p>Created in Photoshop, they are composed of dozens of separate layers of content, including many lighting adjustments. The photos in the background were provided by the Library of Congress. The subject's face was created in Daz 3D, while the hair was painted directly in Photoshop. All other elements were created from photos I personally shot.</p>

                        <p>This is a personal recreation of a composition titled, Nature Rules, which was originally created by the instructor of my college Photo Illustration instructor, Bret Malley. He supplied the artwork's source photography, which consisted of a basic photo of a city, a field, a mountain and a sky. I then completed the remaining work with Photoshop.</p>
                        <p>A guide to follow was given, however I did quite a bit of work outside of the guide to enhance the shading, lighting and color.</p>

                        <p>As a project for my college Database Management class, I worked in a group with two other individuals to develop a database system for a fictional bicycle rental business. Our group name was the Cyber Centurions.</p>
                        <p>The diagram was not directly designed by me, however I played a big part in discussing how the data should be organized to optimize the business's technical capabilities.</p>
                        <p>My team decided that I should be tasked with the creation of the database's SQL Data-Definition script. It was used to automate the creation of the entity tables within Access.</p>

                        <p>The database was implemented in Microsoft Access, complete with data-entry forms and reports that could be generated.</p>
                        <p>It was my job to implement the database into Access. I had a tight deadline to complete it, so this form was created in a rush, but I made certain that it had all of the necessities and was operational.</p>

                        <p>When working in a team, I always make sure that my share of the workload gets done. Whenever a team member needs assistance and I am available to help, I take action to help. When given the opportunity, I will voice my opinion, however I never give into frustration if it is not accepted. Avoiding conflict in a team is incredibly important.</p>

                        <p>When writing (or typing), I make a habit of double-checking the simplicity and professionalism of everything I write. When writing instructions, I often use numbered steps to communicate the process, and I do not skip any steps or information, no matter how obvious it may seem. When programming, I document and explain any code that has even a slight possibility of being misunderstood by any skilled programmer.</p>

When working at Stayton Animal Supply, if a computer was malfunctioning, I was often the employee assigned to remedy it. I also commonly troubleshoot technology issues that occur within my household.</p>
