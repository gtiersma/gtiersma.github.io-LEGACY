            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
            <p>I am a new computer programmer and graphic designer who is ready to enter the tech workforce. Although I may not have much work experience, I enjoy designing software and digital artwork with my free time. I also recently graduated from Chemeketa Community College with an Associates of Computer Science. I learned a wide variety of tech skills there, however my specific focus was centered on learning computer programming. Have a look at my projects and skills below to see what I can do.</p>

                        <p>Project Scaper allows graphic designers that have no 3D modeling experience to create 3D environments. It imports images designed by the user and uses the images as maps to generate the 3D shape.</p>

                        <img class="previewImage" src="" alt="Screenshot of an inventory management system built with Excel">
                        <p>While working at Stayton Animal Supply, I was given the opportunity to design an inventory management system for the business to use, since the business wanted to become more computerized.</p>
                        <p>Coded in Visual Basic, it provided the basic necessities for managing products, such as creating, deleting, editing and searching for items. It was successfully used to calculate the business's product inventory at the end of the fiscal year. It was used for 1-2 months. Management was satisfied with the inventory system, however, they decided to deprecate the project because of a better opportunity to invest in a professional, server-based inventory system.</p>
                        <p>The code is not available online, however I can present it in person upon request.</p>

                        <p>Mod Manager is a file manager allowing users of mods (modified video game files) to easily switch between them. It has received positive feedback from the mod community for the video game, Mario Kart 8.</p>
                        <p>It is programmed in Java with the help of the JavaFX platform. It also uses CSS to stylize the GUI.</p>

                        <p>These compositions were created to contrast the effects that knowledge has on society through time. The top image shows history being studied and a good future on the wall. The bottom image displays history being ignored and a threatening future on the wall.</p>
                        <p>They take place during the early Renaissance, while the pictures on the wall portray the what will come of future in perspective of the Renaissance, specifically the late 1800s and early 1900s.</p>
                        <p>The compositions were created in Photoshop. They are composed of dozens of separate layers. The photos in the background were provided by the Library of Congress. The subject's face was created in Daz 3D, while her hair was painted directly in Photoshop and the armor was created from manipulated photos of a metal pen. All other elements were created from photos I shot.</p>

                        <p>This is a Photo Illustration class exercise that is a personal recreation of a composition titled, Nature Rules, created by the instructor, Bret Malley. He supplied the artwork's source photography, which consisted of a basic photo of a city, a field, a mountain and a sky. I then completed the remaining work with Photoshop. A guide to follow was given, however I did quite a bit of work outside of the guide to enhance the shading, lighting and color.</p>

                        <p>As a project for a database class, I worked in a group with two other individuals to develop a database system for a fictional bicycle rental business. Our group name was the Cyber Centurions.</p>
                        <p>The diagram was not directly designed by me, however I played a big part in discussing how the data should be organized to optimize the business's capabilities.</p>
                        <p>My team decided that I should be tasked with the creation of the database's SQL Data-Definition script. It was used to automate the creation of the entity tables within Access</p>

                        <p>When working in a team, I make a much higher priority of completing my share of the workload.

Avoiding conflict in a team is much more important to me than being treated fairly.</p>

                        <p>When writing (or typing) instructions or information, I spend extra time re-reading everything I wrote, and I usually re-write my sentences a few times to ensure that it is easy to understand. If I was to create a manual for some software, I would prioritize step-by-step instructions and complete sentences throughout. When programming, I document and explain any code that has even a slight possibility of being misunderstood by any skilled programmer (which makes up nearly all of the code I type).</p>

I also commonly troubleshoot technology issues that occur within my household.</p>
